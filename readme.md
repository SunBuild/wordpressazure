WordPress popularity has grown in the past few years and itâ€™s more of CMS framework now and not just a blogging framework. WordPress does not scale out of the box to work with multiple environments. Lots of questions come to mind when working with a CMS/frameworks such as 
- How to break it out into different environments 
- What files can I change and wont impact framework version updates 
- How to manage configuration per environment 
- How to manage modules/plugins version updates ,  core library/framework version updates 

Having a strong understanding of your framework solution is key to help answer the questions mentioned above. Azure Web Apps has a few features that make it easier to store configuration settings outside of your code. This is a fork of wordpress which includes sample configuration files for wordpress app to run in multiple environments on azure web apps.

Pre-requisites:
- Create a staging slot  and staging database
- Create dev slot if there are more than one developer on a project 
- Install [Root Relative Urls] (https://wordpress.org/plugins/root-relative-urls/) on your local developement wordpress site
- Include the configuration files mentioned above with the code changes in wp-config to programmatically choose the right configuration based on environment
- Add App settings for Environment specific configuration [Environment Variables or App settings] (https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2013/07/17/windows-azure-web-sites-how-application-strings-and-connection-strings-work/) that can be used across multiple websites reflecting your staging and production sites

Workflow:
Complete pre-requisties and have a stable version of your development website. 
- Develop your web application 
- Backup your production website 
- Merge your local development database with your production database so all the content is in sync. 
- Deploy  to Staging slot(website) and Test  your application 
- Deploy to production by using SWAP feature of deployment slots . Preview changes in settings of your web app configuration as shown in the Azure portal before executing SWAP operation

Repeat this process during every deployment . **At no point does a team member make changes directly to the Staging or Production environments.**Note that new deployment only occurs in wordpress when 
- Push a code fix 
- Delete/add new plugins
- Update WordPress core
- Upate your theme 

When working with teams involving more than one developer, I recommend using Github to create multiple branches and set up continuous deployment to your development and staging code websites can help provide better source code control to roll back/debug/resolve issues.
